There are some dos and don'ts you need to be aware of now, especially during the crucial first 12 weeks of your <a href=\"/baby\">baby</a>'s development, so do read on and re-plan your diet.</p> <a href=\"/family-food/guide-to-cooking-on-a-budget/healthy-start\">Healthy Start scheme</a> <a href=\"/baby\">baby</a> <p>There are some foods us mums should avoid eating in pregnancy because of their potentially harmful effects on either ourselves or our babies.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"/pregnancy/staying-healthy-in-pregnancy/eating-in-pregnancy-do-s-don-ts\">Here's what to avoid and why:</a></strong></p> <a href=\"/pregnancy/staying-healthy-in-pregnancy/eating-in-pregnancy-do-s-don-ts\">Here's what to avoid and why:</a> <li><strong>Vitamin A supplements</strong> Unless you're advised to take them by a health professional, avoid supplements, including cod liver oil supplements, that contain vitamin A. Large amounts of vitamin A can cause malformations in a developing baby.<br><br></li> <strong>Vitamin A supplements</strong> <li><strong>Liver and liver products</strong> (<em>such as </em>pâté) These may contain large amounts of retinol, the animal form of vitamin A, and should also be avoided.<br><br></li> <strong>Liver and liver products</strong> <li><strong>Raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurised milk or milk products</strong> All could potentially contain the toxoplasmosis parasite, which can affect fetal brain and eye development.<br><br></li> <strong>Raw or undercooked meat, unpasteurised milk or milk products</strong> <li><strong>Raw eggs, or foods containing raw or partially cooked eggs</strong> These could potentially contain salmonella bacteria, which will make you very unwell with severe vomiting, diarrhoea and possibly dehydration. Although your baby won't be affected directly, your health is equally important, and a bad case of salmonella poisoning may require hospitalisation. Cook eggs until firm.<br><br></li> <strong>Raw eggs, or foods containing raw or partially cooked eggs</strong> <li><strong>Blue-veined and mould-ripened soft cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert </strong>Listeria bacteria, which is sometimes found in these cheeses, has been associated with miscarriage and even stillbirth.<br><br></li> <strong>Blue-veined and mould-ripened soft cheeses, such as Brie and Camembert </strong> <li><strong>Caffeine </strong>Research suggests that consuming too much caffeine in pregnancy may be linked to an increased risk of miscarriage or low birth weight. To be on the safe side, switch to decaff beverages or cut out tea and coffee altogether for at least the first three months of pregnancy.<br><br></li> <strong>Caffeine </strong> <li><strong>Alcohol </strong>Recent advice from NICE (the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, which advises the government on best health practices) suggests that pregnant women should limit their alcohol intake to less than 1.5 units per day and, if possible, should avoid alcohol completely in the first three months of pregnancy. Advice from the Department of Health now suggests that expectant mothers should avoid drinking alcohol at all; however, if you do choose to drink, don't down more than 1-2 units of alcohol once or twice a week. One unit is a small glass of wine, a half pint of ordinary strength beer, lager or cider, or a single 25ml (pub) measure of spirits.</li> <strong>Alcohol </strong> <p><strong><a href=\"/pregnancy/staying-healthy-in-pregnancy/eating-in-pregnancy-do-s-don-ts\">More about what to avoid eating in pregnancy<br></a></strong></p> <a href=\"/pregnancy/staying-healthy-in-pregnancy/eating-in-pregnancy-do-s-don-ts\">More about what to avoid eating in pregnancy<br></a> <p>Some foods are considered <strong><a href=\"/pregnancy/staying-healthy-in-pregnancy/healthy-eating-in-pregnancy\">particularly beneficial to pregnant mums</a></strong> and their growing babies, so try to ensure you get them into your daily diet as often as poss (even if it's through swapping your usual snack foods for something on the list at first). All the following foods are not only considered great for you, but all have a low glycaemic index (GI), which mean they are slow to digest and keep you feeling fuller for longer. This in turn will help keep your blood-sugar levels on an even keel, which might even help combat pregnancy sickness.
