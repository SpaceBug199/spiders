		u'Congratulations on your ', u'pregnancy', u'! You have probably very recently done a pregnancy test and, whether this was planned or not, you will have 1001 questions, worries and fears.', u\"We're here to guide you through the next nine months, watching your \", u'baby', u' grow with you, giving you advice when you have concerns, helping you make', u'loads of friends', u' in the same boat as you and - most importantly - letting you enjoy your pregnancy whilst we worry about the other stuff.', u\"If you haven't already started taking a \", u'daily supplement of folic acid', u\", now's the time to do so. Ideally all women will have been taking 400mcg as a one-a-day tablet from the time they decided to try for a baby, but as long as you start now, your baby should still benefit. You can buy the tablets from any good pharmacist.\", u\"Folic acid is important for pregnancy as it can help prevent birth defects known as neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, which can occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. After this time, it's fine to stop taking folic acid supplements again. You can\\xa0get folates (naturally occurring folic acid) by including certain foods, such as certain breakfast cereals and breads,\\xa0in your diet too. (Check the nutritional information to see which brands are fortified.)\", u'Some women have an increased risk of having a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect, and are advised to take a higher dose of 5 milligrams (5mg) of folic acid each day until they are 12 weeks pregnant - check with your doctor if you think you might be at higher risk (for example if you or your partner have a neural tube defect of if you have had a previous pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect.)', u\"Try to eat a healthy, balanced diet to ensure you and your baby get a good intake of vitamins. However it's recommended that you should take a supplement of 10 mg a day of Vitamin D when pregnant and \", u'breastfeeding', u'. Supplements are readily available from pharmacies and supermarkets, or your GP may be able to prescribe them for you. If you want to get your\\xa0folic acid or vitamin D from a multivitamin tablet, make sure that the tablet does not contain vitamin A (or retinol).', u'More about taking folic acid in pregnancy', u\"Ideally you shouldn't smoke, drink alcohol or take any recreational drugs whilst you are pregnant as they can harm both your unborn baby and you. If you are struggling to manage without them do discuss this with your midwife and she should be able to get you some extra support to help you to give up.\", u'Advice on giving up smoking in pregnancy', u'High levels of caffeine can result in babies having a low birth weight and can also cause miscarriage. Caffeine is naturally found in lots of foods, such as coffee, tea and chocolate, and is added to some soft drinks and energy drinks. Some cold and flu remedies also contain caffeine. Talk to your midwife, doctor or pharmacist before taking these remedies.', u\"You don't have to completely forgo caffeine when pregnant but it's important not exceed 200mg a day. The approximate amount of caffeine found in food and drinks is:\", u'one mug of instant coffee: 100mg\\xa0', u'one mug of filter coffee: 140mg\\xa0', u'one mug of tea: 75mg', u'one can of cola: 40mg\\xa0', u'one can of energy drink: 80mg\\xa0', u'one 50g bar of plain (dark) chocolate: around 50mg', u'one 50g bar of milk chocolate: around 25mg', u'To cut down on caffeine, try decaffeinated tea and coffee, fruit juice or mineral water instead of regular tea, coffee, cola and energy drinks.\\xa0', u\"Now that you're pregnant you'll probably want to know all you can about what's going on inside you and what to expect as you go along. \", u'weekly newsletters ', u\"and we'll keep you posted as to what happens when, and what you need to do at each stage of the way. \", u'Your Pregnancy', u\" is another excellent source of information and also includes loads of Netmums' own experiences so you'll never feel alone on your amazing journey to motherhood.\", u\"One of the first questions us mums want answered is \\u2018When's it due?'. You can calculate\\xa0your estimated due date\\xa0quite simply by counting 280 days from the first day of your last period, but you can make an approximation, accurate to within a few days, by using a much quicker method: find the date of the first day of your last period; add on exactly a year; go back three months and add on one week - hey presto, you have your EDD. So: if your last period started on 18 March:\", u'18 March this year + 1 year = 18 March next year', u'Minus three months = 18 December this year', u\"Plus one week = 25 December (in which case, how do you feel about \\u2018Holly' or \\u2018Nicholas' as names?)\", u'Try our Due Date Calculator here', u'Find out how other\\xa0mums feel in early pregnancy by', u\"This is your first week of \\u2018gestation\\u2019, which means the length of time your baby will spend inside you. Although you've probably been completely unaware of it, the most fantastic things have been going on inside you. The inner bit of the embryo, for instance, has started growing into your baby; the outer part is developing into two membranes known as the \\u2018amnion\\u2019 and \\u2018chorion\\u2019.\", u\"The amnion will become the amniotic sac that produces and contains the warm amniotic fluid that will surround and cushion your baby until labour. The chorion will surround the amnion and become the placenta. This part also puts out minute finger-like projections called \\u2018villi\\u2019 to help the embryo to secure itself to the wall of the uterus. Isn't pregnancy a wonderful thing?\", u'SKIP TO 5 WEEKS PREGNANT'
