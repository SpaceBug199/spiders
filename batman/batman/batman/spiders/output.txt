[u'At nine months pregnant, you won\u2019t find Mary Helen Bowers sitting back and eating Nutter Butters and Cheetos. Instead, you find her in fifth position with a demi-pli\xe9!'][u'"(My doctor) is incredibly supportive of me not only continuing with my workout, but also with maintaining my regular routine: running my business, creating a new pre-natal series for BB, the works, \u201c she says. \u201cPregnancy can be a really exciting and creative time."']
[u"When a 35-year-old former body builder Lea-Ann Ellison recently posted a picture of herself lifting weights on Facebook's CrossFit's page, it created a firestorm of comments."][u'She wrote, "8 months pregnant with baby number 3 and CrossFit has been my sanity. I have been CrossFitting for 2 1/2 years and strongly believe that pregnancy is not an illness, but a time to relish in your body\'s capabilities to kick ass."']
[u'Congratulations on your new baby!\xa0 I hope you saved room in your hospital bag, because you\u2019re going to want to stock up on a few essentials before you head home.\xa0 Normally I wouldn\u2019t advocate shoplifting, but mama, you\u2019ve just pushed a cantaloupe out of your coochie--you\u2019re entitled to some SWAG. \xa0'][]
[u"Pennsylvania recently renewed a law making it illegal to touch a pregnant woman's belly without permission.\xa0"][u'Against it?\xa0']
[u'Coco, Apple, Blue Ivy, North West \u2013 we know those are some of the unique names celebrities have chosen for their little ones lately. But would you trust Starbucks customers to choose the name of your child? I can just imagine\u2026 ', u' One ', u'coffee-loving couple', u' from Connecticut did just that when they asked customers to vote on baby names via the coffee-cup-ballot-box.'][u'I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t find something unique and meaningful, I\u2019m just asking parents to be a tad responsible and understand the depth of their decision. Is that really too much to ask?']
[u"There are as many websites and books devoted to pregnancy as there are shades of gray\u2014which is to say, a lot. And yet, there are some pregnancy issues no one seems to have really addressed, or even 'fessed up to.\xa0"][u'\xa0']
[u'Earlier this week, ', u'Marissa Mayer', u', Chief Executive Officer of Yahoo, announced that the company would be extending maternity leave and paternity leave. They are allowing moms sixteen weeks of paid time off and dads eight paid weeks off after the birth of a child. New fathers and mothers who have a child through adoption, surrogacy or foster care receive eight weeks.'][u'I applaud the extended paid parental leave, even if the motivation is to make Yahoo more attractive when recruiting and retaining top talent from competitors. The reality is, we have reached a point where there is not a division between what is good for a company and what is good for the employee.\xa0']
[u'So you\u2019re going to be a gay parent? Congratulations! No doubt you\u2019ve been through a lot to get to this point, whether you\u2019ve traveled the path of adoption, IVF, artificial insemination, surrogacy, fostering or whatever. Now, you have a lot to do to get ready.'][u'I wanted to write this post specifically for you, though, the expectant gay parent, because there\u2019s a whole lot of important parenting stuff they\u2019re not going to cover in those baby classes that applies directly to you. There are some special things you\u2019re going to experience because you have a non-traditional family, and I\u2019ve encountered them, so I wanted to give you my tips on how to deal with them.']
[u'Have you ever considered a home birth? A growing number of women are concerned that the medical interventions practiced during hospital birth actually lead to the complications that doctors claim they are better equipped to handle. Some of these women, like me, choose midwife-assisted births in hospitals and/or hire doulas. Others are choosing to skip the hospital altogether and give birth at home.'][u'The most controversial point in the new guidelines is that the AAP is recommending families use only Certified Nurse Midwives (CNMs); however, most midwives who currently attend home births are Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs). Advocates of home birth are upset that the AAP is favoring one type of certification over the other. They claim that since CPMs are more likely to assist with home births, the AAP is actually trying to shut down home birth in a roundabout way.']
[][u'The season 4 finale left us with a lot more questions than answers, both on and off screen \u2013 with the show being cancelled and then brought back to life, and with the main character ', u' (Brooke Elliot) having doubts at the altar, and Kim telling Jay that she is pregnant with his baby \u2013 so I was anxious to gain some insight into what we can expect this coming season!']
